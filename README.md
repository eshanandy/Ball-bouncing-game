# Ball-bouncing-game

<b> PROBLEM STATEMENT: </b>

The goal of the program is to create a ball bouncing game, including a slider and a ball. The game can be played in Two-Player mode using 2 sliders as well. The game is over when a player fails to hit the ball with his slider in time, and lets the ball ‘miss’.

<b> PROBLEM DEFINITION: </b>

1. Single Player Mode – How long can the player manage to hit the ball?
2. 2 Player Mode – 2 players play at the same time, controlling different sliders. Whoever misses the ball
loses.
3. Game gets progressively difficult – Speed of ball increases automatically, Size of slider continually
reduce
4. Pause Game Feature.
5. Scoring System
6. Recording top 3 scores of all time
7. Settings – User can optimize play area size, and slider length
8. Can be played multiple times in the same runtime- User can return to main menu after game over to start
new game, view scores etc.
9. User-Friendly code and execution.
